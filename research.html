		<h1>Usability Testing</h1>
		<br>

		Usability is one of many important quality attributes that apply to your phone application. Usability can be split into 5 key components: Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors and Satisfaction. (Nielsen , 1999)
<br><br>
		<ul><li>Learnability is how easy it is for a user to accomplish a basic task the first time they are presented with the design (Nielson, 2012).
		</li></ul><ul><li>Efficiency is once a user has learnt the design of the application how quickly can they can perform the tasks (Nielson, 2012).
		</li></ul><ul><li>Memorability is when a user returns to the application after a period of not using it, how quickly that can relearn it (Nielson, 2012).
		</li></ul><ul><li>Errors is the amount of errors the user makes, how many errors they make, the severity of the errors and how they recover from the errors are all factors to be considered (Nielson, 2012).
		</li></ul><ul><li>Satisfaction refers to how pleasant the user finds the application (Nielson, 2012).
		</li></ul>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Why Usability Test?</h2>
<br><br>
		Usability testing allows the design and development team to identify problems within the application before it is released. The earlier issues are identified the less expensive they are in cost as well as man hours (usability.gov, 2015).
<br><br>
		Usability testing can allow you to learn:
<br><br>
		<ul><li>If participants can successfully complete tasks
		</li></ul><ul><li>How long specific tasks take
		</li></ul><ul><li>How satisfied participants are with your application
		</li></ul><ul><li>What changes need to be made to improve users satisfaction
		</li></ul>
<br><br>
		<h2>Methods of Usability Testing</h2>
<br><br>
		There are multiple techniques that can be used to run a Usability Test. Once the test has been planned and the test participants have been recruited a moderating technique has to be chosen that is suitable for the test. (Bergstrom, 2013)
<br><br>
		Some techniques that can be used are:
<br><br>
		<h3>Concurrent Think Aloud</h3>
		The participant speaks aloud their every step and thought.

<br><br>
		<h3>Retrospective Think Aloud</h3>
		When the session is complete the participant is asked to retrace all the steps they completed during the test
<br><br>
		<h3>Concurrent Probing</h3>
		The participants work on tasks and when they say or do something interesting the researcher takes notes.
<br><br>
		<h3>Retrospective Probing </h3>
		After the session is complete the participant is asked questions about the test conducted. This is usually used in conjunction with other methods.
<br><br>
		<h3>Pilot Test</h3>
		Before any testing is done a pilot test must be conducted. This test allows you to check the following:
<br><br>
		<ul><li>The equipment
		</li></ul><ul><li>The researcher can practice note taking
		</li></ul><ul><li>A final check that tasks are clear
		</li></ul><ul><li>Allow you to make any last minute changes
		</li></ul>
